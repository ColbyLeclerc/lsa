## Note on implementation
This is an early prototype of the Lucente Stabile Atkins (LSA) Cryptosystem meant as a 
proof-of-concept, for demonstrative purposes only. As such, the algorithm below is not designed particularly for 
robustness, nor is it representative of the most-efficient practices or programming styles.

This program is meant as a demonstration of the LSA algorithm, and is not cryptographically secure according to
industry best practices of implementing cryptographic systems. Efforts at a more robust program have been spent
towards our closed-source C++ version of the LSA, which uses cryptographic libraries for computation.

For details on the algorithm, see the electronically published paper linked above 

# Requirements
The script was writen using Python `3.7.4` with standard libraries
